jlpt-vocab-n5
=============

A Python 3 vocabulary tester for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test N5 Level.

Takes one argument:
the number of questions to ask per iteration (after each iteration, it will ask the user if they should like to go for another round.)

Unfortunately I cannot find the source of the list. However, I did find one on Wikipedia where the terms were ordered similarly, so I do hope it is in the public domain. Please contact me if you believe that you created the list.
