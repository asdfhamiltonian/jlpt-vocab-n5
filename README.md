jlpt-vocab-n5
=============

A Python 3 vocabulary tester for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test N5 Level.

Takes one argument:
the number of questions to ask per iteration (after each iteration, it will ask the user if they should like to go for another round.)

If I recall correctly, The Japan Foundation published vocabulary lists as part of the Test Content Specifications for each level of the JLPT. Level N5 was created after a new exam was created to bridge the gap between the old N2 and N3 exams. The Japan foundation later moved away from publishing vocabulary and grammar specifications for each exam in 2010. However the lists are still useful as a study tool for each exam.
